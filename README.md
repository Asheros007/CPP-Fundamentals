# C++-Fundamentals
This repository help practice the fundamental skills of C++ to a new programmer. Learn the fundamental concepts of C++ and practice the coding challenges

# C++ Language Skills:
1. Basic Syntax: Writing syntactically correct C++ programs.
2. Variables & Types: Declaring, initializing, and using variables of fundamental types.
3. I/O Operations: Using std::cout, std::cin, std::endl
4. Scope: Understanding local scope and variable lifetime
6. Multi-file Programming: Using headers, header guards, forward declarations.
7. Type Management: Understanding sizes, signed/unsigned, type casting with static_cast
8. Conditionals: Basic if statements
9. Debugging: Using debugger features (breakpoints, stepping, watch variables).

# Programming Competencies:
1. Problem Decomposition: Breaking problems into functions.
2. Code Organizations: Structuring code across multiple files.
3. Debugging Mindset: Systematic error finding and fixing.
4. Type Awareness: Choosing appropriate data types.
5. Compilation Process: Understanding build process and errors.
